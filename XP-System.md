# XP System

## Overview
NATION's XP system demonstrates the power of unity through collaborative rewards. By combining WILLPOWER's AI capabilities (87% accuracy) with CHANDELIER's mathematical proofs, we create an ecosystem where value grows through shared success and edge-based collaboration.

## Core Components
### Edge Foundation
- Network positions (100 seats)
- Edge creation system
- Quality validation
- Growth mechanics

### Unity System
- Team amplification
- Shared success metrics
- Network growth share
- Value contribution

### Challenge Framework
- Edge validation
- Network stability
- Quality verification
- Growth tracking

## Reward Structure
### Foundation Rewards
- Edge creation bonuses
- Network validation share
- Challenge completion
- Growth participation

### Unity Rewards
- Team collaboration
- Shared success bonuses
- Network growth share
- Value contribution

### Challenge Rewards
- Quality validation
- Network stability
- Edge development
- Growth tracking

## Performance Metrics
### AI Capabilities
- Pattern recognition: 87% accuracy

## Event System Development Prompt

Please help me validate and expand our SKENAI XP/Proposal event system by providing:

1. Additional Event Types & XP Values:
   - User actions beyond current set (onboarding, tasks, etc)
   - Proposal quality/speed bonuses
   - Team achievements
   - Governance participation rewards
   - Validator/reviewer incentives
   - Special event multipliers
   - Comment quality rewards

2. Database & Flow Patterns:
   - DynamoDB schema optimizations
   - Efficient index patterns for:
     * XP aggregation/leaderboards
     * Proposal status tracking
     * Comment threading
     * Validation history
   - Event flow through stack:
     Next.js → API → Redpanda → Lambda → DynamoDB

3. System Mechanics:
   - XP corrections/rollbacks
   - Proposal versioning
   - Comment moderation
   - Validation queues
   - Achievement unlocks
   - Leaderboard updates
   - Search optimization
   - GFORCE voting weight

4. Edge Cases & Scaling:
   - High-volume event handling
   - System maintenance periods
   - Disputed actions
   - Data consistency
   - Cache strategies
   - Performance bottlenecks

This will help finalize our event schemas and ensure proper integration with SKENAI's infrastructure.
