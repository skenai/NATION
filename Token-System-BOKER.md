interface ITokenSystem {
    // SHIBAKEN Integration Research
    function stakeSHIBAKEN(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 lockPeriod
    ) external returns (uint256 bokerAllocation);

    // BOKER Markets Research
    function createMarket(
        bytes32 proposalId,
        uint256 initialLiquidity
    ) external returns (address marketPair);

    // Bitcoin Reserve Research
    function allocateReserve(
        uint256 networkRevenue,
        uint256 energyCost
    ) external returns (uint256 bitcoinAmount);
}
```

### Market Making API Research
```typescript
// RESEARCH CODE - Under development
interface TokenSystemAPI {
    // Market Operation Studies
    createOrder(market: string, params: OrderParams): Order;
    provideLiquidity(market: string, amount: number): Position;
    
    // Reserve Management Research
    checkReserveStatus(): ReserveMetrics;
    claimRewards(marketId: string): Reward;
}
```
