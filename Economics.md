- Network positions (100 seats)
- Edge creation mechanics
- Quality validation
- Growth tracking

### Unity System
- Team amplification
- Shared success metrics
- Network growth share
- Value contribution

### Challenge Framework
- Edge validation
- Network stability
- Quality verification
- Growth tracking
