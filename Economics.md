# NATION Economics

## Overview
NATION's economic model demonstrates the power of unity through an innovative edge-based staking system. By combining WILLPOWER's AI capabilities (87% accuracy) with CHANDELIER's mathematical validation, we create a network where value grows through collaboration and shared success.

## Edge System
### Foundation
- Network positions (seats) form the core structure
- Edges connect positions to create value flows
- Edge strength determines network impact
- Initial opportunity: 100 foundation seats

### Edge Evolution
- Quality-based growth
- Network validation
- Challenge completion
- Value optimization

### Edge Types
1. FOUNDATION
   - Core network stability
   - High impact validation
   - Network governance

2. SECURITY
   - Network protection
   - Value verification
   - Challenge validation

3. EFFICIENCY
   - Resource optimization
   - Flow improvement
   - Cost reduction

4. NETWORK
   - Position connectivity
   - Edge development
   - Value distribution

## Staking Mechanics
