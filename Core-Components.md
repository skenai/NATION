# NATION Core Components

NATION is built on four essential components that work together to create collective intelligence:

## 1. Stake SHIBAK
- Entry requirement to participate
- Minimum stake: 10M SHIBAK
- Lock period: 6 months minimum
- Shows commitment to network

## 2. WILLPOWER Chat
- AI-human interface for knowledge creation
- Available to all stakers
- Helps refine proposals
- Guides edge formation

## 3. Make Proposals
- Community-driven direction
- Must be substantive
- WILLPOWER-enhanced
- Foundation for edges

## 4. Form Edges
Edge formation is the core growth mechanism of NATION. Each edge represents a meaningful connection between participants, backed by SHIBAK stakes and focused on value creation.

## Network Culture

NATION grows through:
- Thoughtful collaboration

- Pure speculation
- Mindless staking
- Random connections

## Network Metrics

We track four key metrics:
1. Stakes Active
   - Total SHIBAK staked
   - Average stake duration
   - Number of stakers

2. WILLPOWER Chats
   - Chat frequency
   - Proposal refinements
   - Knowledge creation

3. Proposals Made
   - Proposal quality
   - Implementation rate
   - Community engagement

4. Edges Formed
   - Active edges
   - Edge duration
   - Value creation

## Next Steps

1. Launch initial staking mechanism
2. Deploy WILLPOWER chat interface
3. Open proposal submissions
4. Form first foundational edge
