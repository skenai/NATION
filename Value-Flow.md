# Value Flow System

## Overview
The NATION value flow system implements GFORCE's mathematical framework through six fundamental components, each bounded within [0,1000] to ensure network stability and completeness. The system leverages WILLPOWER's pattern recognition for validation and CHANDELIER's mathematical proofs for completeness.

## Value Components
Each node in NATION's network carries six GFORCE components:
- **g**: Genesis value (foundation strength)
  * Growth through FOUNDATION challenges
  * Impact on network stability
  * Validated by WILLPOWER

- **f**: Flow strength (network connectivity)
  * Initial and maximum bounds
  * Growth through successful challenges
  * Network connectivity impact

- **o**: Operational efficiency (pattern optimization)
  * Enhanced through EFFICIENCY challenges
  * Validated by WILLPOWER metrics
  * Pattern optimization focus

- **r**: Resource allocation (stake distribution)
  * Minimum stake requirements
  * Network size-based distribution
  * Balanced growth mechanics

- **c**: Challenge completion (validation metrics)
  * Quality-based scoring system
  * Success rate validation
  * Impact boundaries

- **e**: Edge evolution (growth potential)
  * Strength evolution mechanics
  * Growth through challenges
  * Network stability focus
